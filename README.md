<p>A React CRUD app allowing users to create, organise and keep track of invoices.</p>

<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>Majority of the UI is based upon a project from <a href="http://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a>. With only basic functionality specified in the initial challenge, I decided to implemnt a backend adding database and user authentication functionality.</p>

<h2>Built with</h2>

<ul>
   <li>React (create-react-app)</li>
   <li>SCSS (CSS pre-processor)</li>
   <li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
   <li>Firestore (NoSQL Database)</li>
   <li>Firebase user authentication</li>
   <li>Framer Motion (animation library)</li>
   <li>Deployed via Render</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>Allowing a logged in user Create, read, update, delete and store invoices. Invoices can be saved as drafts or pending, in which their status can be changed in the future via the UI.</p>

<p>In addition, invoices can be filtred by their status.</p>

<p>Finally, the user can toggle between light and dark mode, in which their last used setting will be saved to localStorage.</p>

<p>I created a <b>Demo account</b> to allow you to be able to use and explore the application, the <b>details</b> are as follows:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Email: demo@invoiceapp.com</li>
   <li>Password: password</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things Learnt</h2>

Upon completion of this project, there are a few key areas I feel I have improved in:

<ul>
   <li>Authentication, understanding the fundementals of implementation.</li>
   <li>Firestore NoSQL Databse, especially designing it's architecture.</li>
   <li>SCSS Mixins, reducing repeated CSS</li>
   <li>Database security rules.</li>
   <li>React components, making more reusable components to increase maintainability.</li>
   <li>Routable modals, much easier and cleaner implementation instead of tracking a modal's open state directly.</li>
</ul>
