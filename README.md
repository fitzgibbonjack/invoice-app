<h2>About the projects</h2>

<p>Majority of the UI is based of a project from <a href="http://www.frontendmentor.io">http://www.frontendmentor.io</a>. With only basic functionality specified, I implemnted a backend adding a database and user authentication to the project.</p>

<h2>Built with</h2>

<ul>
   <li>React (create-react-app)</li>
   <li>SCSS (CSS pre-processor)</li>
   <li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
   <li>Firestore (NoSQL Database)</li>
   <li>Firebase user authentication</li>
   <li>Framer Motion (animation library)</li>
   <li>Deployed via Render</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<h2>Things Learnt</h2>

Upon completion of this project, there are a few key areas I feel I have improved in:

<ul>
   <li>Authentication, understanding the fundementals of implementation</li>
   <li>Firestore NoSQL Databse, especially designing it's architecture</li>
   <li>SCSS Mixins, reducing repeated CSS<li>
   <li>Database security rules
   <li>React components, making more reusable components to increase maintainability</li>
   <li>Routable modals, much easier and cleaner implementation instead of tracking a modal's open state directly</li>
</ul>
